What if I told you there was something that you can do right now that would have an immediate positive benefit for your brain, including your mood and your focus? And what if I told you that same thing could actually last a long time and protect your brain from different conditions, like depression, Alzheimer's disease or dementia? Would you do it? Yes. I am talking about the powerful effects of physical activity that is simply moving your body, has immediate, long-lasting and protective benefits for your brain.
